In Dr. Nina Gierasimczuk's *Logical Theories for Uncertainty and Learning* course the students were introduced to epistemic logic with the perspective of using it to model uncertainty and how agents can use such models to contemplate epistemic problems in multi-agent scenarios. Teaching was very influential on me and has been something I've sought out in subsequent positions.
