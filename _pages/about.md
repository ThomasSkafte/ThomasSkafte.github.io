In the pursuit of developing dialectical planning to navigate towards a desired outcome in a dialogue I study argumentation theory, deontic logic, dialectical logic, modal logic, belief revision and non-monotonic logics in general. 

I have previously worked in the field of robotics with autonomous navigation where I've developed software architecture for goal planning and autonomous recovery.
